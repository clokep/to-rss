  <h3>The Background</h3>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> is a great way to
  distribute news (or really any article) in a distributed manner for reading by
  news aggregators. This helps automate pulling of content so that you don't
  need to go to a bunch of separate sites each day to see what's new (normally
  this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication">web
  syndication</a>).
</p>

<p class="lead">
  <h3>Why?</h3>

  Unfortunately, with the rise of social media, there's a bunch of sites which
  no longer feel the need to provide syndication feeds (or want you to ingest it
  only by signing up for their platform). This makes it difficult to keep
  up-to-date with those sites.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  <h3>What?</h3>

  We try to solve this problem by giving syndication feeds (in the form of RSS
  feeds) to sites that could easily have feeds. You can find a list below of
  sites, each one might have multiple feeds, click the links below to find out
  more.
